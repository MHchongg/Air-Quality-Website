            <p>
                Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air from natural and human sources, causing health risks and environmental damage. We must reduce emissions and adopt cleaner technologies for healthier air.

                <h3>US AQI</h3>
                <p>
                    The U.S. AQI is EPA’s index for reporting air quality.
                    Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. 
                    The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. 
                    For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.

                    Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when levels in air are high. 
                    PM2.5 are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated.

                From the <span class="greenText">IQAir World Air Quality Ranking Map 2022</span>, we can clearly observe the information related to air quality worldwide. 
                We have the ability to compare our country's cities with other cities in <span class="greenText">Southeast Asia</span>. 
                As a result, we can determine which country has the <span class="greenText">worst air quality</span> in <span class="greenText">2022</span>. 
                We can use various pieces of information for this comparison, including the <span class="greenText">ranking of the most polluted cities in 2022</span>, <span class="greenText">the annual average of PM2.5 levels in 2022</span>, and <span class="greenText">historical PM2.5 averages</span>.

                In order for a city or country to be classified as <span class="greenText">moderately polluted</span> requires a <span class="greenText">PM2.5</span> reading anywhere between <span class="greenText">12.1 to 35.4 µg/m³</span>, 
                putting <span class="greenText">Malaysia</span> somewhat at the lower end of this moderate spectrum, 
                however as it can be observed, there are months throughout the year that <span class="greenText">experience rapid spikes in pollution</span>, 
                and as such it is of importance to take this into account,
                both in regards to the yearly average rating as well as the causes and appropriate measures that may be taken against it.
                In terms of how polluted it is in <span class="greenText">comparison to other countries in south east Asia</span>,
                it can be seen that <span class="greenText">Malaysia </span> actually came in with a significantly better placing than many of its <span class="greenText">ASEAN</span> (Association of South East Asian Nations) neighbors, 
                coming in with a better position ahead of countries such as <span class="greenText">Thailand</span>,

                        Malaysia experiences varying levels of air pollution throughout the year. 
                        Urban areas, especially those with industrial activities and high population density, 
                        often face higher pollution levels. 
                        Major contributors include vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and open burning. 
                        Efforts have been made to improve air quality through regulations and initiatives, 
                        but certain regions still face challenges in maintaining consistently good air quality.

                        The country also experiences episodes of haze due to forest fires and agricultural burning. 
                        The government has taken measures to improve air quality, including enforcing emission standards and promoting sustainable transportation.
